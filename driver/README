Cross-platform library for LCDs with HD44780-compatible controllers written in
pure C99 (C 1999 year standard). The library is designed to allow you to write
GPIO drivers for your hardware platform without rewriting the library itself,
thus making it truly platform independent.

Originally this was a direct port of LiquidCrystalExt library for Arduino,
from C++ classes to plain C functions and structures, but now it only
resembles the original interface and is quite different inside.

At the moment there are several GPIO drivers available for the following
microcontroller families:
 * STM32F10x
 * STM32F2xx
 * STM32F4xx
 * STM32L1xx

More will be added in the future.
